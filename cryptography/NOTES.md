### Euclidean Algorithm

Euclidean algorithm is used for calculating ``greatest common divisor(gcd)``, algorithm says,
```
    gcd(r0,r1) = gcd(r1,r0(mod)r1) ; where r0 > r1
```
[Implementation](../math/gcd/gcd.go)

### Extended Euclidean Algorithm
Extended Euclidean Algorithm allows us to compute modular inverse of a number, mathematically we can express

``` 
    gcd(r0,r1) = (S*r0) + (T*r1)
```
Proof
``` 
    we can express, r0 = (q0)*(r1) + r2
    also for index i,
    r(i-2) = S(i-2)*r0 + T(i-2)*r1       ------- (1)
    r(i-1) = S(i-1)*r0 + T(i-1)*r1       ------- (2)

    also,
    r(i) = r(i-2) + q(i-1)*r(i-1)        ------- (3)
    from equation (1),(2) & (3)

    r(i) = [S(i-2) - q(i-1)*S(i-1)]r0 + [T(i-2) - q(i-1)*T(i-1)]r1
    the last iteration will give the value of S and T
    => S(i) = S(i-2) - q(i-1)*S(i-1)
    => T(i) = T(i-2) - q(i-1)*T(i-1)
```

This Algorithm can also be use for finding inverse in Finite fields (Galois Fields)
,r0 in case finite field will be ineducable function P(x), this will give S(x) and T(x)

### Euler's Phi Function
Its is defined as number of element in Ring **Z(m)** {0,1,2,3..m-1} which are co-prime of **m**.
```
    The number of integers in Z(m) relatively prime to m is denoted by Φ (m).
    solution;
        Let,
                m = ((p1)^(e1))*((p2)^(e2))...((pn)^(en)) 
        be a prime factorization of m
        then;
                Φ (m) = ∏ (((pi)^(ei))-((pi)^(ei-1)))
```

Property used in RSA :-

It is easy to compute phi(m) if prime factorization of m is known, and difficult if prime factorization is not know

```
    It is important to stress that we need to know the factorization of m in order to
    calculate Euler’s phi function quickly in this manner. As we will see in the next
    chapter, this property is at the heart of the RSA public-key scheme: Conversely, if
    we know the factorization of a certain number, we can compute Euler’s phi function
    and decrypt the ciphertext. If we do not know the factorization, we cannot compute
    the phi function and, hence, cannot decrypt.

### Fermat’s Little Theorem
```
    Let a be an integer and p be a prime, then:
        a^p ≡ a( mod p)
    also, 
        a^(p-1) = 1 mod p
     => a*a^(p-2) = 1 mod p
     => = a^(-1) = a^(p-2) mod p
```

### Euler’s Theorem
```
    Let a and m be integers with gcd(a, m) = 1, then:
        => a ^(Φ(m)) ≡ 1 ( mod m).
```

### Introduction To Public-Key Cryptography

Basic Idea behind PKC, Let say Alice wants to send a message **x** to Bob securely over an unsecured channel.
```
        ---------                                   ---------
        | Alice |                                   | Bob   |
        ---------                                   ---------
            |                                           |
            |                                           |
            |   1. bob send his Public Key (kPub)       |
            |<------------------------------------------|
            |                                           |
            |                                           |
    2. y = enc(x,kPub)                                  |
            |                                           |
            |                                           |
            |   3. Alice send cipher text               |
            |------------------------------------------>|
            |                                           |
            |                                           |
            |                                   4. x = dec(y,kPrv)
            |                                           |
            |                                           |
            |___________________________________________|

    
    x    :         plain text
    y    :         cipher text
    enc  :         encryption function
    dec  :         decryption function
    kPub :         Public Key
    kPrv :         Private Key
```
Unlike in symmetric key cryptography (DES,AES) encryption and decryption is done using a same shared key,but in un-symmetric key cryptography encryption is done using public key and decryption using a private key.

### 3 Type of PKC
1. [RSA](#RSA)

### RSA
RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) algorithm can divided into two part
#### 1. [Key Generation](#RSA-Key-Generation)
#### 2. [Encryption](#RSA-Encryption)
#### 3. [Decryption](#RSA-Decryption)

#### RSA Key Generation
1. Choose a very large prime number p,q
2. Compute n = p*q
3. Compute phi(n)=(p-1)(q-1)
4. Choose a number **e** from set {2,3,4... phi(n)-1}, such that gcd(e,phi(n)) = 1 (or e and phi(n) should be co-prime) and to ease the computation requirement for encryption, most commonly e = (1<<16)+1 is choose
5. Compute d, such that e.d = 1 mod phi(n)

Now, kPub = (e,n) and kPrv = d

##### RSA Encryption

```
    y = x^e mod n
```

##### RSA Decryption

```
    x = y^d mod n
```

    for i = n-1 To 1
        r = r*r mod n
        if h(i) == 1:
            r = r*x mod n

    return r
```

### Prime Number Test Using Fermat’s Little Theorem
For a prime number **p** and integer **a** in {2,3...p-2}, a^(p-1) = 1 mod p
```
    for i = 1 to S
        choose random a from {2,3...p-2}
        if a^(p-1) != 1:
            return false
    return true
```
S is a security parameter
### Prime Number Test Using Miller–Rabin Theorem
```
        Given the decomposition of an odd prime candidate p̃
                p̃ − 1 = 2^(u)*r
        where r is odd. If we can find an integer a such that
                a^(r) !≡ 1 mod p̃        and        a^(r*2^j) !≡ p̃ − 1 mod p̃
        for all j = {0, 1, . . . , u − 1}, then p̃ is composite. Otherwise, it is probably a prime.
```

Pseudo code
```
    Input   : p (prime candidate) , s (security parameter)
    Output : true (p is likely prime) , false (p is composite)
    INITIALIZE r , u ( p -1 = 2^(u)*r)

    for i = 1 to S: [security loop]
        z = a^r mod p
        if z == 1 or z == p-1:
            goto security loop
        for j=1 to u - 1
            z=(z*z) mod p
            if z == p-1:
                goto security loop
        if z!=p-1:
            return false
    return true
